      <description>Summary  Introduction to Machine Learning Anatomy of a supervised ML system Steps of an ML project  Introduction to Machine Learning A first definition  &amp;ldquo;The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed&amp;rdquo; (Arthur Samuel, 1959).
 Learning machines? Machine Learning is a set of techniques for giving machines the ability to learn from data, in order to:
 Identify or classify elements Detect tendencies Make predictions  As more data is fed into the system, results get better: performance improves with experience.</description>

      <description>Summary  K-NN in a nutshell K-NN for classification K-NN for regression  K-NN in a nutshell  Instance-based (no model construction). No training phase, computations happen during predictions. $ \neq $ K-Means algorithm. Very simple yet often efficient. Can be used for classification or regression.  K-NN for classification A new point is assigned to the class which has the most representatives within the k nearest neighbors of the point.</description>
